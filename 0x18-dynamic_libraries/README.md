Static Libraries:
Linking Time:
Compilation Time: The code from a static library is included at compile time. The linker copies all used functions from the library into the executable.
Size:
Executable Size: Since the library code is included in the executable, the size of the executable file is larger.
Performance:
Performance: Generally, static linking can result in faster performance because all code is present in the executable, and there is no need to load external libraries during runtime.
Flexibility:
Flexibility: Once the executable is created, it does not rely on external libraries. It can be run on any system with the required operating system and architecture without needing the library separately.
Dynamic Libraries:
Linking Time:
Runtime: Dynamic libraries are linked at runtime. The linking process is deferred until the program is executed.
Size:
Executable Size: The size of the executable is smaller since it only contains references to the functions in the dynamic library, not the actual code.
Performance:
Performance: Loading dynamic libraries at runtime can introduce a slight overhead, but it allows for more flexibility and efficient use of system resources. Changes in the library do not require recompilation of the executable.
Flexibility:
Flexibility: Dynamic linking allows for shared libraries, meaning multiple programs can use the same library, reducing disk space and memory usage.
Summary:
Static Libraries:
Linked at compile time.
Larger executable size.
Better performance (in terms of startup time).
Less flexible regarding updates to the library.
Dynamic Libraries:
Linked at runtime.
Smaller executable size.
Slight overhead during runtime.
More flexible for updates, as changes in the library don't require recompilation of the executable.
